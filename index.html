                    <p class="text-justify img-fluid">I am 29 years old and a huge goal of mine is to be employed as a
                      full-stack
                      develepor by the time
                      I'm
                      30.
                      I've
                      mainly come from a laborer background, I spent 5 years as an associate at Walmart after I
                      graduated
                      high
                      school.
                      My
                      first position there was a shipping associate. I, then, was promoted to shipping clerk within 1
                      year
                      of
                      employment.
                      I worked as a Shipping Clerk for roughy 2 years before getting a promotion again as yard driver.
                      As
                      a
                      yard
                      driver
                      I was trusted with hauling Walmart and non-Walmart trailers on property, pulling to and from
                      dock
                      bay
                      doors.

                      After 5 years of service with Walmart I decided to 'broaden my horizons' by attempting to join a
                      union
                      program
                      as
                      an electrical lineman. I failed in being accepted into the program and then became employed by
                      East
                      Coast
                      Lumber
                      in Hampstead, NH. I worked as a general laborer for 1 year before accepting a job with
                      Communications
                      Construction
                      Group as a Groundhand. The duties as a Groundhand were to assist the construction foreman with
                      various
                      tasks
                      thoughout the day to finish jobs. The main objective in a job is to run fiber or Co-axial cable,
                      sometimes
                      both,
                      from a point on the telephone lines to the destination (customer's suite). After roughly 8
                      months
                      of
                      employment
                      as
                      a Groundhand I was promoted to the Warehouse Manager. In this job I was tasked with inventory of
                      various
                      materials
                      needed to install fiber and Co-axial cable, as well as performing safety checks on the workforce
                      out
                      of
                      the
                      office
                      I am employed. As of october 1st, 2019, I was promoted to a Fiber Splicer. My primary objective
                      is
                      to
                      splice
                      the
                      fibers onto the Comcast network resulting in Fiber Optic internet for the client.
