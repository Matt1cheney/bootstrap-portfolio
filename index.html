            <!--about me-->
            <div class="col-md-9">
              <p>I am 29 years old and a huge goal of mine is to be employed as a full-stack develepor by the time I'm
                30.
                I've
                mainy come from a laborer background, I spent 5 years as an associate at Walmart after a graduated
                high
                school.
                my
                first position there was a shipping associate. I then was promoted to shipping clerk within 1 year of
                employment.
                I worked as a Shipping Clerk for roughy 2 years before getting a promotion again as yard driver. As a
                yard
                driver
                I was trusted with hauling Walmart and non-Walmart trailers on property, pulling to and from dock bay
                doors.

                After 5 years of service with Walmart I decided to 'broaden my horizons' by attempting to join a union
                program
                as
                an electrical lineman. I failed in being accepted into the program and then became employed by East
                Coast
                Lumber
                in Hampstead, NH. I worked as a general laborer for 1 year before accepting a job with Communications
                Construction
                Group as a Groundhand. The duties as a Groundhand were to assist the construction foreman with various
                tasks
                thoughout the day to finish jobs. The main objective in a job is to run fiber or Co-axial cable,
                sometimes
                both,
                from a point on the telephone lines to the destination (customer's suite). After roughly 8 months of
                employment
                as
                a Groundhand I was promoted to the Warehouse Manager. In this job I was tasked with inventory of
                various
                materials
                needed to install fiber and Co-axial cable, as well as performing safety checks on the workforce out
                of
                the
                office
                I am employed. As of october 1st, 2019, I was promoted to a Fiber Splicer. My primary objective is to
                splice
                the
                fibers onto the Comcast network resulting in Fiber Optic internet for the client.
