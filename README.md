# bootstrap-portfolio
using rows and columns with bootstrap I created a basic webpage with a little about myself and a contact me page. 
lastly I successfully put the text along side my portrait image but I could not figure out how to have text fill entire width of screen when the page broke. 
I added links for the toggle bar to work with phones
